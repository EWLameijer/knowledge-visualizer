// not beautiful: relationshiptype enum same as class...



5... make it with graphics


// problems:
I want to compare the relationship string to the strings in the classes.
What are my options?
-I can make a map of string to Type



1. Create white window, large part of screen
2. create data structure, graphlike.

	Node - type of relationship [enum] - Set<Node>


Relationship:
has origin (1)
has targets (1..)
can have parameters (like hasWithDefault[internal])

Node -> set of relationships, each of different type 

First: print node
