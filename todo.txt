To do:
1) Make buttons repel one another
2) Draw lines between buttons
3) make lines into unidirectional arrows
4) make lines contract like springs until min-length


// Not sure if it is ever necessary: wherever you step, never step outside the borders!

5... make it with graphics


// problems:
I want to compare the relationship string to the strings in the classes.
What are my options?
-I can make a map of string to Type



1. Create white window, large part of screen
2. create data structure, graphlike.

	Node - type of relationship [enum] - Set<Node>


Relationship:
has origin (1)
has targets (1..)
can have parameters (like hasWithDefault[internal])

Node -> set of relationships, each of different type 

First: print node

Okay. What is the LANGUAGE?

Basically I have a vector, which has direction and size.
