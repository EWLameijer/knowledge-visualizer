1. Show simple concept + relationship in console // Done
2. NEXT load this from file instead of source code
    1. read all concepts
    2. read concepts including relationships
        okay. For each line I need to determine the depth
        If is adding targetConcepts AND depth ==1 // new relationship, origin stays constant
        if is adding targetConcepts AND depth ==0 // save things so far, clear origin.

4... write to file
    4a: modify print of relationship to be like you expect
        so class (concept)
              can have
                constructor // DONE!

3... add concept or relationship
5... make it with graphics


// problems:
I want to compare the relationship string to the strings in the classes.
What are my options?
-I can make a map of string to Type



1. Create white window, large part of screen
2. create data structure, graphlike.

	Node - type of relationship [enum] - Set<Node>


Relationship:
has origin (1)
has targets (1..)
can have parameters (like hasWithDefault[internal])

Node -> set of relationships, each of different type 

First: print node
